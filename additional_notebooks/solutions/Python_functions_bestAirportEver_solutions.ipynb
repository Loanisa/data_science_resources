The time ranges will be:\n","    * *Morning*:     5 am to 12 pm (noon)\n","    * *Afternoon*:   12 pm to 5 pm\n","    * *Evening*:     5 pm to 9 pm\n","    * *Night*:       9 pm to 4 am\n","\n","To do so, we have received a dataset that contains the information from all the flights leaving the LA ariports in 2018:\n","\n","Los Angeles Airports are:\n","* Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)\n","* Ontario International Airport (ONT)\n","* John Wayne Airport (SNA)\n","* Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR)\n","* Long Beach Airport (LGB)\n","\n","Dataset information:\n","* fl_datetime: flight date time\n","* tailnum: Plane tail number.\n","* carrier: Two letter carrier abbreviation.\n","* origin, dest: Origin and destination.\n","* dep_time, arr_time: Actual departure and arrival times (format HHMM or HMM), local tz.\n","* dep_delay, arr_delay: Departure and arrival delays, in minutes.
